## Database Design
The database schema was designed to efficiently organize the pizza sales data. The schema includes the following tables:

- **Orders**: Stores order details such as order ID, date, and time;
- **Pizzas**: Contains information about different pizza variants, including their names, sizes, categories, and ingredients;
- **Order_Details**: Links orders to pizzas, capturing quantities, prices, and other order-specific details.


### Database Schema

## Recommendations

### Focus on Popular Pizzas:
- Increase marketing and promotion efforts for the top-selling pizzas, such as The Classic Deluxe Pizza and The Barbecue Chicken Pizza, to maintain high demand and boost revenue.
- Expand the product line by introducing new variations of popular pizzas to attract existing customers who already prefer these flavors.
- Analyze key factors that contribute to the popularity of these pizzas (e.g., ingredients, pricing) and apply them to improve less popular offerings.


### Optimize Operations During Peak Hours:
- Ensure sufficient stock and staffing during peak hours from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM to maximize revenue. Consider offering special promotions such as combo deals during these hours to further increase sales volume.



### Less Profitable Hours

#### Analysis of Low Sales Hours:
- The sales during the hours of 09:00, 10:00, and 23:00 are significantly lower compared to peak hours. For instance, the revenue at 09:00 was just $332, at 10:00 it was $730, and at 23:00 it was $3,121 for the entire year.
- However, we lack data on staffing levels and employee wages, which would be necessary for a more in-depth analysis of operational efficiency during these low-sales periods.

#### Recommendation 1: Optimize Staffing:
- If staffing levels during these low-sales hours are the same as during peak hours (12:00, 13:00), consider adjusting the number of staff to better align with the reduced demand. This could help reduce operational costs while maintaining service quality.

#### Recommendation 2: Consider Reducing Operating Hours:
- Another option is to reduce operating hours by closing the store during 09:00, 10:00, and 23:00. The sales during these times are minimal and likely do not justify the cost of keeping the store open.
    - Closing during these hours could also be presented positively to staff as an effort to improve work-life balance, allowing employees to start later or finish earlier.
- Alternatively, consider testing marketing initiatives, such as "early bird specials" or "late-night discounts," to attract more orders during these hours before deciding to close. Analyze customer demographics to target specific segments that could be interested in ordering during these times.

#### Additional Observation:
- The low sales during these times appear consistent throughout the year, indicating it may be a result of low demand due to the time of day rather than operational changes. The exception is at 09:00, where most orders were recorded in November as a single large order (16 pizzas), the average order size is typically around 2 pizzas (2.32, to be precise). This could suggest an outlier event rather than consistent demand.

### Encourage Sales on Less Profitable Days of the Week:
- Consider introducing special offers or promotions on Sundays and Mondays to stimulate sales on these less profitable days.
- Implement themed promotions such as "Monday Blues Discount" or "Family Sunday Special" to make orders on these days more attractive.

### Reevaluate Strategies by Month:
- Since certain months have shown below-average revenue, consider introducing seasonal promotions or new product offerings during these periods to boost sales.
- Analyze the seasonality and events that could impact demand and align promotions accordingly to create a targeted sales campaign.



### Focus on Popular Pizza Sizes:
- Continue to offer a wide range of Large (L) and Medium (M) pizzas as they generate the most revenue.
- Consider optimizing ingredient procurement or reducing inventory costs for less popular sizes like XL and XXL to minimize losses, or remove these options altogether if they do not justify their costs.
